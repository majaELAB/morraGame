Morra is a hand game that dates back thousands of years to ancient Roman and Greek times. 
Each player simultaneously reveals their hand, extending any number of fingers, and calls out a number. 
Any player who successfully guesses the total number of fingers revealed by all players combined scores a point.

Morra can be played to decide issues, much as two people might toss a coin, or for entertainment.
